# Aspect Ratio Calculator

A JavaScript-based aspect ratio calculator that helps users determine and adjust resolutions while ensuring dimensions are evenly divisible by 8. The tool also includes a framing feature that compares content against different frame sizes. This simulated visual output can also possibly help people who don't intuitively understand aspect ratios, cropping (not shown but i hope the frame vs content boxes visual would be enough as it is), letterboxing, and pillarboxing concepts.

## Features
- **Aspect Ratio Selection**: Choose from a predefined list of common aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3, 16:9, 21:9) or custom/unlocked via the drop-down menu.
- **Dynamic Resolution Adjustment**: Updates width and height values while maintaining the selected aspect ratio.
- **Divisibility by 8**: Ensures all calculated dimensions are evenly divisible by 8 - this helps to optimize videos and images for compression algorithms and hardware processing.
- **Frame Comparison**: Allows users to enter a frame size and see how content fits within it - your monitor, TV, and phone displays count as a "frame" in this context.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays calculated aspect ratios, frame ratios, and content-to-frame fit status (letterboxed, pillarboxed, or exact match).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sean1138/aspect-ratio-calc.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
1. Select an aspect ratio from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the content width or heightâ€”changes will automatically update the other value to maintain the ratio.
3. Modify the frame width and height to compare content fit.
4. View real-time simulated visual representation, ratio calculations, and fit status.

## Customization
- Modify the `aspectRatios` object in `aspect-ratio-calc.js` to add new aspect ratios.
- Adjust styling in `styles.css` to customize the UI.

## Credits
1. ChatGPT handled most of the javascript and gave me a draft readme to work with.
2. [pico.css](https://picocss.com/) because I didn't feel like writing any and i like the basic idea behind the pico repo.
